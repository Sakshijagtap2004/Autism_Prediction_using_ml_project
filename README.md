# Autism_Prediction_using_ml_project
This project aims to address this challenge by leveraging machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model capable of identifying individuals at risk of autism based on various behavioral factors.


Objectives:
 To develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting autism spectrum disorder based on individual characteristics and behavioral patterns.
 To identify the most significant predictors contributing to the classification of autism, providing insights into the underlying factors associated with the disorder.
 To evaluate the performance of the developed model using appropriate metrics and techniques, ensuring its reliability and generalization ability.
